# 🕵️‍♂️ Detection of Fake Website using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect **fake (phishing) websites** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various URL-based and content-based features, the model classifies websites as **legitimate** or **malicious**, helping users stay safe from online frauds.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Predicts if a website is **Legitimate** or **Fake**
- 🔍 Extracts critical URL and website features for analysis
- 📊 Trained using multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- 🧠 Supports real-time predictions
- 💡 Feature importance analysis included
- 🧪 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

We use publicly available phishing datasets such as:

- [Phishing Websites Dataset – UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites)
- URL-based datasets with labeled features (`legitimate` or `phishing`)
